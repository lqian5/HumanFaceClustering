## Image clustering

Author: Qian Li

This project used image analysis techniques such as:
- cropping and aligning faces in the profile pictures,
- read a folder of images and flatten each image to a vector,
- reconstruct original faces using PCA dimention reduction, 
- construct adjacency matrix using cosine similarity,
- draw network plot using networkx
- clustering
