## Reconstruct faces using PCA and apply network analysis using similarity metric

Author: Qian Li

This project used image analysis techniques such as:
- cropping and aligning faces in the profile pictures,
- read image as a matrix and convert it to long vector,
- reconstruct original image using PCA dimention reduction, 
- calculate cosine similarity,
- draw network using networkx
